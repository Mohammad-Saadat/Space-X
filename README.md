# Space-X
This project is a test project for dynamo company

Develop an application that allows a user to:

See the list of all SpaceX rocket launches
Select a launch from the list and display a small amount of information about the launch, including displaying the date, location, rocket name, launch patch image, etc.
Use the SpaceX API described here: https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/tree/master/docs/v4

The application should make use of the REST API. However, it should not simply fetch all the data once, rather ensure that the app displays fresh data, so that it is always up-to-date as long as there is a data connection. Although itâ€™s a simple project, please treat the task as you would a real app, so that the true quality of your work is reflected in what you submit for us to review.

Prefer to do it in MVP or MVVM architecture. If you can write testable code, it is even better.
